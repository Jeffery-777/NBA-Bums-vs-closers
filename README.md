# NBA-Bums-vs-closers
Analyzing how bums are more successful than star closers when it matters most. 

I included both the markdown and a word version of that same markdown showing all code used.

The six data files (2014-2019) holds play by play data for each and every playoff game of that year. This data from the past 6 years is 
what's used to determime "bum" shooting percentage after filtering out various star players.

Clutch_Complete is a dataset with various super stars that contains each players career results for clutch qualifying shots. I obtained this from NBA 
Advanced Stats. You'll also notice data for "bums" is included in this too (at least just FG attempts and FG makes which is all that I needed) 
So this bum data from the past six years is used to compare the rest of the stars in that data set to see how they stack up.
